- A standalone client and API for mass downloading osu! beatmaps

<br>

Motivation
- Outside of a few peer hosted torrents, there was no easy way to download a lot of beatmaps at one time. Users usually download maps one at a time using the osu! client or through the official website which was very arduous.

<br>

Technology
- Utilises Cloudflare R2 for mass data serving without huge egress bills
- Electron + React Client with a triply data bound string, input, and tree query editor
- Golang backend to serve filter results and update the beatmap collection.
